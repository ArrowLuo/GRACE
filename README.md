# GRACE

*CODE IS ON THE WAY, PLEASE STAY TUNED.*

The implementation of Findings of EMNLP 2020 paper titled 

[GRACE: Gradient Harmonized and Cascaded Labeling for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10557). Huaishao Luo, Lei Ji, Tianrui Li, Nan Duan, Daxin Jiang. Findings of EMNLP, 2020.

This paper proposes a GRadient hArmonized and CascadEd labeling model (GRACE) to solve aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect sentiment classification (ASC) tasks. The imbalance issue of labels in sentiment analysis is involved in this paper.
